      Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
      How I wonder what you are.<br>
      Up above the world so high,<br>
      Like a diamond in the sky<br></p>

        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. <em>Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.</em><br>
        <em>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong></em><br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <em>we are born to learn.</em><br>
        <strong>Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</strong><br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        <strong>Until one day,</strong> <em>you walk.</em><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <em>This. is. learning.</em><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        <em><strong>You just don’t get it, yet.</strong></em><br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</em><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>You only have to know one thing:</strong><br>
        <em><strong>You can learn anything.</strong></em>
